# IS-211-2

1. Theory tasks:
a)   What are the two essential operations of a Stack? Mention two other useful but nonessential operations
    - push(), pop()
    - peek(), empty()

b) What data structures are commonly used in a database index? Why?
    - B-Trees

c)   What are the most important features and advantages of the hashmap data structure?
    - Strengths:
        - Fast lookups. Lookups take O(1) time on average.
        - Flexible keys. Most data types can be used for keys, as long as they're hashable.

2. Search tasks:

Given this array of numerical elements:{4, 2, 7, 6, -3, -1, -2, 42, 0, -42, 9, -4, 5, -5, -6, -7, -8, -99, 42, 11, 20, 1, 2, 3}

For each task, chose a suitable data structure for searching the given array and argue for your choice, and submit the Java-code from solving the task, and the output from running it.

Write a programme that finds and prints:

a)   All consecutive sub-arrays in the given array that adds up to zero.b)   All pairs of elements (anywhere in the array) that adds up to zero.c)   The locations in the array of the smallest and largest number in the array (starting on 1, not 0, so conversion may be necessary if the indexing is zero-based)
